## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. Feel free to try to edit any of the text or code below. The green triangle in code can be used to test code (always a good plan). You can add new R code "chunks" by using the "insert" button above, or just copy text as it is done  below. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r mpg}
mpg
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, col=displ ))+theme_bw()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.For homeworks etc, this is a bad idea, we always want to see the code. 

### Including external images
Useful for home works.
